An inference that always brings peace

### Problem Statement

There are features in programming languages that are desirable by themselves but also run at odds to one another. I have 12 such features and a language that contains all of them but the type inference algorithm is not obvious.

I suspect that strong normalization is possible in this language, but it remains an open problem. When type inference is complete we can say that the program is "at peace" so that is where this project name comes from.

### Language Specification

[term] A term can always be represented as a lambda calculus term.

[type] A type can always be represented nominally with possible internal structure expressable as a lamba calculus term.
